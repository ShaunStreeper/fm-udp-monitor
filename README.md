# Forza Telemetry Data Monitor
Listen for UDP telemetry data from Forza Motorsport 2023 and display in real time.

I'm just messing around, and you should [check out other people's repositories](https://github.com/search?q=forza+telemetry+stars%3A%3E0&type=repositories&s=updated&o=desc) that may have actual usable applications that make use of the Forza telemetry.
